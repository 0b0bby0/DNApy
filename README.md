DNApy
=====

A free and open source GUI toolkit for DNA editing - written in python

This project aims to provide a powerful codebase for viewing, editing and creating DNA in the GenBank format. The code is free to use, modify and re-distribute under a GPL license. Contributions in the form of improvements and new functions are welcome and encouraged!

The software is being developed on a Linux machine and works well in that environment. As the software matures I will start testing on Windows and Mac so make sure it is cross-platform. The only external library that is needed is wxPython. Launch main.py to give the software a go (it is still under heavy development though).
